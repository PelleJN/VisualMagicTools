vMAJOR.NEWGIZMO.UPDATEDGIZMO

v0.6.0
 - Added SimpleDistort v1.0.0
     - This node performs a very simple distortion of the image using fbm noise added to an ST map.
 - The JumpFlood node is now listed as "JumpFlood_AlphaDistance" in the search menu, as was intended. It will still be added simply called "JumpFlood".
 - NukeBake and NormalLight have turned back to Gizmos from Groups, since they were using onCreate callbacks that were not working on groups.
 - Reformatted some entries in the changelog file.

v0.5.1
 - Removed FloodFill in favor of JumpFlood. FloodFill is not the name of the algorithm. I don't know when I started calling it that.

v0.5.0
 - Added FloodFill v1.0.0
     - This node performs the Flood Fill algorithm on the alpha of the provided image, giving you the distance from each pixel to the alpha.
     - To make it easier to find when searching, the gizmo's name is actually "FloodFill_AlphaDistance".
 - All nodes are now saved out from Nuke 16.0v1.
 - All nodes are now Groups by default rather than Gizmos, and have the Disable Group View checkbox ticked since you dont't really need to look inside those very much.
 - Updated all existing gizmo version numbers to their current version + 0.0.1 (hopefully I didn't miss any)

v0.4.1
 - Updated AOVEdit to 1.1.0
     - Mask input now properly masks only the edits made to the AOV rather than the entire image, which was messing with the "View AOV" option.
     - The edited AOV can now be replaced by enabling "Overwrite AOV". This was intended to always be the case before but I am stupid and it didn't work. I am now less stupid.
     - The node is now added as a group instead of a Gizmo, allowing you to open it. This should not affect any other functionality.
     - Fixed a typo in the info panel where Visual Magic was spelled as VIsual Magic.

v0.4.0
 - Added ColorToColor v1.0.0
 - Updated AOVEdit to v1.0.0
     - No longer has the goal of managing multiple AOVs in one node.
     - Now has a saturation slider
     - Now has a mask input and a mix slider (I think it had one of these before but I forgot which)
 - A bug with NukeBake hs been noted relating to the node sometimes not reading the bake at the intended time. Clicking Live View and Read should fix this for now, but a new version is in the works.
 - Added some icons

v0.3.0
 - Added NukeBake v1.0.0
 - menu.py will now load the "python" subfolder as a plugin path
 - Added some icons

v0.2.1
 - Updated NormalLight to v1.1.0
     - NormalLight's mask now affects the Alpha it outputs.
     - NormalLight now lets you output the light by itself, without the source image.
     - NormalLight now lets you extend the light outwards from where it is generated, resulting in softer light.
     - NormalLight now has a radius slider, affecting how far the light reaches, and a button to preview its reach.
     - NormalLight no longer uses the entirety of "Luma to Normals" by Erwan Leroy. If you need the control it provides, plug it into NormalLight as custom normals.
