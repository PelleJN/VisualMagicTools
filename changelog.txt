v0.2.1
 - Updated NormalLight to v1.1.0
    - NormalLight's mask now affects the Alpha it outputs.
    - NormalLight now lets you output the light by itself, without the source image.
    - NormalLight now lets you extend the light outwards from where it is generated, resulting in softer light.
    - NormalLight now has a radius slider, affecting how far the light reaches, and a button to preview its reach.
    - NormalLight no longer uses the entirety of "Luma to Normals" by Erwan Leroy. If you need the control it provides, plug it into NormalLight as custom normals.
